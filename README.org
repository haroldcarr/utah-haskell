Utah Haskell Infrastructure

Participants send answers to via [[http://www.serpentine.com/wreq][Wreq]] to a [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty][Scotty]]-based web service
that poses additional challenges.

The Scotty server also displays what participants send via
[[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/threepenny-gui][threepenny-gui]].  We will have a laptop plugged into a projector.  That
laptop will have a browser pointing to the threepenny-based display.

#+begin_example
wreq  -->  scotty  --> threepenny gui <-- browser
