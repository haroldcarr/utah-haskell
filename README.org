Utah Haskell Infrastructure

* main components and interaction

Participants send answers to via [[http://www.serpentine.com/wreq][Wreq]] to a [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty][Scotty]]-based web service
that poses additional challenges.

The Scotty server also displays what participants send via
[[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/threepenny-gui][threepenny-gui]].  We will have a laptop plugged into a projector.  That
laptop will have a browser pointing to the threepenny-based display.

#+begin_example
wreq  -->  scotty  --> threepenny gui <-- browser
#+end_example

* build/run

#+begin_example
stack build
stack exec utah-haskell-exe &
#+end_example

The above:
- starts scotty at [[http://127.0.0.0:3000]]
  - this is where 'wreq' requests should be sent
- starts threepenny-gui at [[http://127.0.0.1:8023]]
  - the browser connects here

Then send requests:

#+begin_example
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/users
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/users/1
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/reg?email=foo
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/JUNK
#+end_example

Besides seeing the CURL responses, the browser will display the requests.

* TODO

- a "real" threepenny display pane that scrolls (so it shows/keeps all history)
- prepare scotty for the specific assignment (I'm thinking about FOLD exercises)
